# Replication files for "Heterogeneous Preferences"

Abstract: 

> The empirical literature on spatial voting models usually focuses on the 
> behavior of the average voter. However, when distance in multiple issues are
> evaluated simulta- neously, voters may exhibit different preferences with
> regard to the weight they assign to each dimension. This paper analyzes the
> specification of the voting equation in multiple dimensions when there is
> variation in preferences at the individual level. I apply the model to three
> Spanish regions in which the political arena is decided in the ideological and
> national dimension (Galicia, Basque Country, and Catalonia). The model
> indicates that not only the average individual but most voters are indeed more
> attentive to ideology rather than to nationalism. A predictive simulation for
> different trade-offs between the two dimension shows the substantive relevance
> of individual heterogeneity.
